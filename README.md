This is a repository to publish/share/experiment with new adapters, prototypes or functionality that can potentially be incorporated into the [Phalcon Framework](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon).

We also welcome submissions of snippets from the community, to further extend the framework.

The code in this repository is written in PHP.
